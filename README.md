#H1 README.md

##H2 My understanding of the uniqueness of this file.

This is first line of README.md. 
This file is in a repository that has the same name as my user name. 
This README file therefore becomes unique because it is supposed to be an introduction to me.

##The problem is that I am not sure what I want to convey about myself.
**I want my code to speak for itself.**

##A little about me.
I am new to git and git.hub.
So right now I am learning to use it.
!. I have created a repository.
2. I am now writing my first file.
3. I an learning Markdown.
Next I will have to learn how to get my program from my computer into git.hub.

##Greetings

Please stand by, **I have a lot to learn.**
